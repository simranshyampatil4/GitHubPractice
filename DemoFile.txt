GitHub is a web-based platform that provides a collaborative environment for software developers to work together on projects. It is primarily used for version control and source code management, allowing developers to track changes to their codebase, collaborate with others, and manage different versions of their software. GitHub also supports various other features that facilitate the software development process, such as issue tracking, project management, and code review.

Key features of GitHub include:
3. **Collaboration**: GitHub makes it easy for developers to collaborate on projects. Multiple developers can work on the same repository simultaneously, and changes can be reviewed and merged using pull requests.

4. **Pull Requests**: Pull requests (PRs) are proposals for changes that one developer has made to a repository. Other developers can review the changes, discuss them, and then merge them into the main codebase if they are deemed appropriate.

5. **Issues and Bug Tracking**: GitHub provides an issue tracking system, where developers can report bugs, suggest enhancements, and discuss project-related topics. Issues can be assigned to specific team members and tracked throughout their lifecycle.

6. **Wikis and Documentation**: Repositories can include wikis and documentation, making it easier for developers to understand the project and its components.

7. **GitHub Actions**: This feature enables developers to automate various tasks, such as testing, building, and deploying code, directly from the repository.

8. **Project Management**: GitHub provides tools to create and manage project boards, allowing teams to organize tasks and track progress.

9. **Community and Social Interaction**: GitHub has a strong community aspect, as developers can follow projects, star repositories they find interesting, and contribute to open-source projects.

10. **Integration**: GitHub can be integrated with other tools and services, such as continuous integration (CI) systems, code analysis tools, and deployment platforms.
